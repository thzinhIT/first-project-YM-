To what extent do you agree or disagree?.</p><div class=\"\"><Image src=\"https://ahphong.vercel.app/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2Fln7oca3i8ulo%2F4UQWKOajZPZAaqCD5YOtsM%2Fb1e2b1369115d88b758a674083484e81%2FGeneral-Startup-Statistics.jpg&w=1920&q=75\" height={500} alt=\"chó\" class=\" object-cover w-full\"/></div><div><p class=\"text-white text-lg my-4\">In the Digital Marketing era, advertising is not only part of business strategy of a company, but also is a part of everybody’s daily routine. While some people do not like this type of strategy, others believe that it is something good for people's life. In my opinion, I partially agree with the statement due to the negative effects that commercials could cause on some customers.</p><p class=\"text-white text-lg my-4\">To begin with, all types of information are being published through advertisements. The main benefit is this data is available to everybody, so they can compare among brands before purchasing. For example, if someone is planning to buy goods on an e-commercial marketplace, but there is a bewildering range of possible options to choose then advertisements can help a customer to make the right choice which suits their pockets. Besides, creativity is part of advertising so creating beautiful posters to enjoy while travelling by airplane or by bus which makes up a colourful city.</p><p class=\"text-white text-lg my-4\">On the other hand, some people consider that advertising is largely unnecessary and intrusive. It always appears annoyingly because it is constantly surrounded by loud images and sounds which disturb our personal lives. For instance, when you are enjoying a video on Youtube, a short advertising video intterrupts suddenly, that is a bad experience. Consequently, the clients will have a bad impression with advertisements as well as brands that made it. Moreover, there are companies proposing strategies such as editing colors of products compared to their real colors of it, quality exaggeration to appeal to more customers. It seems smart, but it will be a loss of confidence in users if they realize the fact.</p></div>",
